# LineageOS 14.1 for the Huawei Y550

This is a fork of the official `cherry`-device in the LineageOS tree of supported devices. Its purpose is to continually build an up-to-date custom ROM for the Huawei Y550 device(s).

I have no idea on how to do this exactly, but I would like te learn.
Stick around, find out what's going on and please contibute!

Kind regards,
