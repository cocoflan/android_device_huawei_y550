# LineageOS 14.1 for Huawei Y550

This is a fork of the official `cherry`-device in the LineageOS tree of
supported devices. Its purpose is to continually build an up-to-date Android
7.1.2 custom ROM for the Huawei Y550 device(s).

The main forum thread on the Y550 devices is located at [XDA-developers][1]. I
will post my ROMs there regularly for downloading and testing. I am no expert,
but am learning my way around. Please stick around, find out what's going on and
feel free to contribute!

Kind regards,
FWieP
